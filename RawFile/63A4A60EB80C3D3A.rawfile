In addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information. However, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.

You also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. This section describes how to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests. The reporting information required by the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations &sect; 999.317 is available <u>here</u> (<a href=\"https://www.activision.com/legal/ccpa-report\">https://www.activision.com/legal/ccpa-report</a>).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Right to Request Access to Your Personal Information</strong></p><p>California residents have the right to request, up to two times in a 12-month period, that we disclose the categories of your personal information we collect, use, and share.

Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Right to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information</strong></p><p>You may also request that we delete personal information that we collected from you.

If you have an online account you use to interact with Activision, logging into your account will serve to verify your identity and request. We may request additional information if we believe your account has been compromised. If you do not have an account with us, or if we have reason to suspect that the security of your account is compromised, then we will request additional information from you to match with our existing records to verify your identity, depending on the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the information sought.</p><p>Once we have verified your identity (and your agent, as applicable), we will respond to your request as appropriate. If we are unable to complete your requests, we will provide you information about the reasons that we could not comply with your request.</p><p><strong>Right to Nondiscrimination</strong></p><p>We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights.</p><p><strong>Sale of Personal Information</strong></p><p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), gives California residents the right to opt out of the sale of personal information.</p><p>We do not sell information that directly identifies you such as your name, telephone number, mailing address or email address. We also do not provide customer personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.</p><p>We share certain information with third parties who do work on our behalf for the business purposes we describe above.</p><p>We also may allow third-party advertising companies to collect information about your activity on our websites and in our apps, for example through cookies, mobile ad identifiers, pixels, web beacons and social network plugins.

You can set up cookie controls and opt-out of advertising cookies, including third-party advertising cookies, by clicking the &ldquo;Cookie Settings&rdquo; link in the footer of our websites. You can also set up cookie controls through many browser settings and you can use industry-wide opt outs to control the use of cookies for interest-based advertising purposes. You may also opt out through the settings page of Activision mobile applications that may share your data for these purposes. You can find additional information in the <strong>Mobile Advertising</strong> section above and in our <u>Cookie Policy </u><u>(</u><a href=\"https://www.activision.com/legal/cookie-policy\">https://www.activision.com/legal/cookie-policy</a>).</p><p>The personal information collected through these methods is associated with your browser or device, so if you would like to opt-out for this information you will need to disable cookies or trackers as described above. Because your opt-out preference is stored in a cookie, if you reset your advertising ID or clear your cookies then we will not recognize your device or your choices, so you must opt-out again.</p><p>In addition to the opt outs related to advertising above, we support the CCPA by allowing California residents to opt out of any other future sale of their personal information by clicking <u>here </u>(https://www.support.activision.com/privacyrequest?st=ca).

IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT OR TO PURSUE CLAIMS IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.</p><p>These BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or acquired and use the Product in the United States. In the United States, this Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (&ldquo;FAA&rdquo;) and federal arbitration law. These provisions may also apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or acquired and use the Product from outside the United States. See JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW below for details.</p><p>To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you and Activision agree to submit all Disputes between us to individual, binding arbitration pursuant to the provisions in this Section 4. A &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo; means any dispute, claim, or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) between you and Activision that in any way relates to or arises from any aspect of our relationship, including, without limitation, your use or attempted use of the Product, all marketing related to the Product, all Services, Service Provided Content, and Virtual Currency, any licensed content, and all matters relating to or arising from this Agreement (including Activision&rsquo;s Privacy Policy and all other terms incorporated into this Agreement) or any other agreement between you and Activision, including any disputes over the validity or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate. A Dispute shall be subject to these BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions regardless of whether it is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory. This includes claims or requests for relief that accrued before you entered into this Agreement. You understand that there is no judge or jury in arbitration and that court review of an arbitration award is limited.</p><p><strong>Initial Dispute Resolution</strong>: Activision's Customer Support department is available at https://support.activision.com/ to address any concerns you may have regarding the Product. Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers' satisfaction. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any Dispute between us, you and Activision agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before either party initiates any arbitration or court proceeding (the &ldquo;Initial Dispute Resolution Period&rdquo;). That period begins upon receipt of written notice from the party raising the Dispute. If Activision has a Dispute with you, it will send notice of that Dispute to your billing address and email address you have provided to us. If you have a Dispute with Activision, you must notify us in writing at the following email address: legalaffairs@activision.com, using the subject line &ldquo;Initial Dispute Resolution Notice.&rdquo; Your notice of Dispute must be individual to you and must include your name, the screen name and/or email address associated with your player account, and your residential address. The notice of Dispute also must describe the Dispute, explain the facts of the Dispute as you understand them, and tell Activision what you want us to do to resolve the problem. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any Dispute directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, and you agree that a notice of Dispute containing all of the information required above, followed by at least 30 days of good faith negotiation, are preconditions to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. A notice of Dispute will not be valid, will not start the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, and will not allow you or Activision later to initiate a lawsuit or arbitration, unless it contains all of the information required by this paragraph. If either of us commences an arbitration without having previously provided a valid and compliant notice of Dispute, you and Activision agree that the applicable arbitration provider (or the arbitrator, if one has been appointed) must suspend the arbitration until the party that initiated it complies with the Initial Dispute Resolution Period. You and Activision authorize the arbitration provider or the arbitrator to decide summarily whether the party that commenced an arbitration complied with the Initial Dispute Resolution Period requirement, relying solely on this Agreement and the notice of Dispute (if any) that you or Activision provided before commencing arbitration.</p><p><strong>Binding Arbitration</strong>: If a Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiations during the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to formally resolve the Dispute, unless an exception applies as stated below. Except in the event of a Mass Arbitration (as defined below), the arbitration will be administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the &ldquo;JAMS Rules&rdquo;) effective as of the date of the Notice of Dispute, which are available at the JAMS website, http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration, as modified by this Agreement. If, for any reason, JAMS is unable to provide the arbitration, then except as otherwise stated below, you may file your Dispute with any national arbitration company that handles consumer arbitrations following procedures that are substantially similar to the JAMS Rules.</p><p>Arbitration hearings may be conducted by videoconference unless the arbitrator believes an in-person hearing is necessary. In such instances, the location of an arbitration hearing will be decided pursuant to the JAMS Rules. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Los Angeles County, California, and you and Activision agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Los Angeles County, California, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p><p>The arbitrator will make a decision in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on you and Activision, and any award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p>The arbitrator shall determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement, including whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator has authority to decide all issues of validity, enforceability or arbitrability, including, but not limited to, where a party raises as a defense to arbitration that the claims in question are exempted from the arbitration requirement or that any portion of this agreement is not enforceable.</p><p>If a lawsuit filed in court includes claims or requests for relief that are arbitrable and claims or requests for relief that are not, you and Activision agree that any non-arbitrable claims or requests for relief shall be stayed pending the completion of the arbitration of the arbitrable claims or requests for relief.</p><p><strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>: TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND ACTIVISION AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. To the extent applicable law does not permit waiver of private attorney general claims, but permits them to be arbitrated, then such claims shall be resolved in arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.</p><p>If any provision in Section 4 of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of this Agreement remaining in full force and effect. <strong>The foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or collective actions as provided for above. This means that if the prohibition against class or collective actions is found to be unenforceable for any reason, the entire Section 4 of this Agreement (but only Section 4) shall be null and void.</strong></p><p><strong>Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims:</strong> Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the Product under this Agreement. Such claims are subject to the jurisdiction and applicable law provisions in Section 5.</p><p>Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for any individual disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction. If an arbitration is filed, before the arbitrator is formally appointed either party can send written notice to the opposing party and the applicable arbitration provider that it wants the case decided by a small claims court, after which the arbitration provider may close the case.</p><p><strong>Exception &ndash; Mass Arbitration Before FedArb: </strong>Notwithstanding the parties&rsquo; decision to have arbitrations administered by JAMS, if 20 or more demands for arbitration are filed relating to the same or similar subject matter and sharing common issues of law or fact, and counsel for the parties submitting the demands are the same or coordinated, you and we agree that this will constitute a &ldquo;Mass Arbitration.&rdquo; If a Mass Arbitration is commenced, you and we agree that it shall not be governed by JAMS Rules or administered by JAMS. Instead, a Mass Arbitration shall be administered by FedArb, a nationally recognized arbitration provider, and governed by the FedArb Rules in effect when the Mass Arbitration is filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (the &ldquo;FedArb Rules&rdquo;), and under the rules set forth in this Agreement. The FedArb Rules are available at https://www.fedarb.com/ or by calling 1-650-328-9500. You and we agree that the Mass Arbitration shall be resolved using FedArb&rsquo;s Framework for Mass Arbitration Proceedings ADR-MDL, available at https://www.fedarb.com/. Before any Mass Arbitration is filed with FedArb, you and we agree to contact FedArb jointly to advise that the parties intend to use FedArb&rsquo;s Framework for Mass Arbitration Proceedings ADR-MDL. The individual demands comprising the Mass Arbitration shall be submitted on FedArb&rsquo;s claim form(s) and as directed by FedArb. You and Activision agree that if either party fails or refuses to commence the Mass Arbitration before FedArb rather than JAMS, you or Activision may seek an order from JAMS compelling compliance and directing administration of the Mass Arbitration before FedArb. Pending resolution of any such requests, you and we agree that all arbitrations comprising the Mass Arbitration (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) shall be stayed.</p><p><strong>30 Day Right to Opt Out</strong>: You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration agreement and class action waiver provisions in this Section 4 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following email address: legalaffairs@activision.com, using the subject line &ldquo;Arbitration Opt-Out.&rdquo; The notice must be sent within 30 days of purchasing the Product (or if no purchase was made, then within 30 days of the date on which you first access or use the Product and agree to these terms); otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of this Section 4. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Activision also will not be bound by them.&nbsp;</p></li><li>JURISDICTION, AND APPLICABLE LAW AND CONTRACTING PARTIES<p>The Product is made available subject to the terms of this Agreement. If you acquired and use the Product from:</p><ol type=\"A\"><li><strong>For residents in the United States, Mexico or Canada</strong>, then any claims or requests for relief arising out of this Agreement (including interpretation, claims for breach, and all other claims or requests for relief (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims)) will be subject to the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to conflict of laws principles. If any court or arbitrator determines that the \"Class Action Waiver\" paragraph set forth above is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then any and all claims arising out of this Agreement (including interpretation, claims for breach, and all other claims or requests for relief (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims)) shall be decided under the laws of the state where you were a citizen at the time you obtained or bought the Product that was subject to this Agreement.

Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude you or Activision from removing to federal court a case originally filed in state court, if federal court jurisdiction exists. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any claim or request for relief in a demand for arbitration filed pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement, as well as any claim or request for relief in a lawsuit filed in court under an exception to the arbitration agreement in Section 4, shall be barred if filed more than two (2) years after the date that the claim or request for relief accrued.</li><li><strong>For residents in the European Union and the United Kingdom</strong>, then the laws of England and Wales govern the interpretation of this Agreement and apply to claims for breach of it, without reference to conflict of laws principles.
